			<p class='description'> <span> Overview: </span> Bernd and Hilla Becher were two German photographers whose systematic documentation of their country’s industrial landscape has served as the basis for an entire school of contemporary photography. Their black-and-white images served as visual case studies or typologies of disappearing architectural relics—water towers, grain silos, gas tanks—forming the basis of their practice. “I became aware that these buildings [blast furnaces] were a kind of nomadic architecture which had a comparatively short life—maybe 100 years, often less, then they disappear,” the artists said of their work. “It seemed important to keep them in some way and photography seemed the most appropriate way to do that.” </p>
